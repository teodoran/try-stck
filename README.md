Try STCK
========

This is the repo for a webpage running STCK in the browser. Fable is used in order to transpile the interpreter from F# to JavaScript. [Try it live here](https://teodoran.github.io/try-stck).

The browser REPL-framework is borrowed from [WebREPL](https://github.com/tormaroe/webrepl) by Torbjørn Marø. Huge kudos to him! Check out his [blog-post](http://programmeringsbloggen.no/2013/02/22/webrepl-en-javascript-basert-kommandolinje/) about WebREPL as well.
